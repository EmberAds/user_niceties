#User Niceties.  

(c) 2012 EmberAds Ltd.  

This is intended to be a few utilities for making handling users in our apps a bit easier.  We use Resque and ActiveRecord, so it all depends upon them.  

We expect a User model with an email field.  

We expect a password_resets table (generator for the migration to come).  

There is no polish in this project yet.  It's probably safer if you just ignore it for the time being - but if you really want to look, it's available under the MIT licence.
